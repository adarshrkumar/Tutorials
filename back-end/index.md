# Back-End Programming

## What is Back-End Programming?

Back-end programming involves building the server-side of web applications that handle data processing, business logic, databases, and APIs. Back-end developers work with servers, databases, and application logic to power the functionality behind what users see on the front-end. Common back-end languages include JavaScript (Node.js), Python, Java, and Ruby.
