# WebSockets

## What is WebSockets?

WebSockets is a protocol that enables real-time, bidirectional communication between a client and server over a single TCP connection. Unlike HTTP, WebSockets allow the server to push data to the client without the client requesting it. This makes WebSockets ideal for chat applications, live notifications, gaming, and other real-time features.
